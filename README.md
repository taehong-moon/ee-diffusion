# A Simple Early Exiting Framework for Accelerated Sampling in Diffusion Models

## Introduction
Welcome to the implementation of our ICML 2024 accepted paper, "A Simple Early Exiting Framework for Accelerated Sampling in Diffusion Models." This repository contains the code and resources necessary to reproduce the results presented in the paper. Our framework introduces a novel early exiting strategy to significantly accelerate the sampling process in diffusion models without compromising the quality of generated samples.

## Update News

- [x] DiT experiments updated
- [ ] UViT experiments update
